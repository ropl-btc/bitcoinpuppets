## Content Context

Bitcoin Puppets is a community-driven, free mint Ordinals collection. The broader lore stems from OPIUM (Ord Puppet Inu Undoxxed Millionaire) and a shared ethos of world peace, memes, and experimental art. This site is designed to celebrate the culture rather than sell a roadmap.
