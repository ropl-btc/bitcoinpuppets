          Art in its purest form is a manifestation of individuality. The
          no-collab thesis asserts that the very essence of Bitcoin
          Puppets&apos; unique vision and narrative is the expression of a
          single artist. Artistic expression flourishes unbridled by compromise
          or dilution. Collaborations in the ordinals/NFT ecosystem often
          devolve into attention-grabbing spectacles, where the collective
          effort overshadows the intrinsic value. The no-collab thesis liberates
          the project from the pressure to conform to trends or compromise on
          integrity for the sake of visibility.

          The allure of collaboration often masks a perilous reality (despite
          the often thought-of win-win scenario): the devaluation of the
          project. When art becomes a mere utility, a means to an end in a
          collaborative endeavor, its inherent value is compromised. The
          no-collab thesis acts as a guardian against such devaluation, ensuring
          the project is not reduced to a mere cog in a collective machine.

          Art forms a profound connection between the creator and the collector.
          By adhering to the no-collab thesis, we preserve the sanctity of this
          connection, undiluted by external influences. In an ecosystem that
          champions collaboration as the epitome of success, the no-collab
          thesis challenges the illusion of win-win scenarios. It contends that
          true success lies in the unwavering pursuit of a project untainted by
          compromise. In conclusion, the no-collab thesis is a defiance against
          the commodification of art.
